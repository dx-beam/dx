# Introduction

In the following sections, we'll learn...

- what [predicates](02_predicates.md) are, and how to define rules to assign their values
- how [associations](03_associations.md) are easily traversed when defining rules
- combining [conditions](04_conditions.md) to define more complex rules
- using [references](05_references.md) to compare multiple fields or predicates with each other
- passing in [arguments](06_arguments.md) from the outside context in which rules are evaluated
