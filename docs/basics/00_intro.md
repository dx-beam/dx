# Introduction

In the following sections, we'll learn...

- what [predicates](01_predicates.md) are, and how to define rules to assign their values
- how [associations](02_associations.md) are easily traversed when defining rules
- combining [conditions](03_conditions.md) to define more complex rules
- using [references](04_references.md) to compare multiple fields or predicates with each other
- passing in [arguments](05_arguments.md) from the outside context in which rules are evaluated

Finally, we close with a chapter on [Thinking in Dx](06_thinking_in_dx.md), learn to apply
all the lessons learnt.
